## Info
This game was built using javascript, and following a test driven development pattern, it heavily utilises the object oriented programming framework to code the pokemon and the battles. The game was built using a modular and class based format to be easily extended, and modified to add new functionality, or new pokemon.  
The repo uses Inquirer.js. A javascript library that allows the user to interact with programs using the terminal. It uses asynchronous coding to allow user input, wait for it to be recieved, and work with the return values.

## Testing
The tests can be run by installing jest: `npm install jest`  
After installing javascript and jest, you must update the package.json file, under "scripts", change "test" to `"jest"`  
You will then be able to run `npm test` to run the tests  
The jest version used in this repo was 29.5.0
